    * Mono Cecil(http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil)
      Cecil is a library to generate and inspect programs and libraries in the ECMA CIL form, written by Jb Evain.
      NAnonym emits IL by using classes that are in Cecil and official System.Reflection.Emit namespace.
      
      NOTE: 
        To build NAnonym uses the most recent source code of Cecil as needed because I uses examples from it.
